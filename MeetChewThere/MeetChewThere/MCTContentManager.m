She was able to tell us exactly what was gluten and dairy free and even checked with the cooks on multiple ingredients! I found out I was able to have all the meats, the coleslaw, and the potatoes. I ordered the baby back ribs meal with coleslaw and an extra side of the brisket. She even told the cooks to be extra careful! Made me feel so comfortable the entire time. Finally our food came and I was able to have the sauces which were good, but the meat was even good by itself! Now I am someone that loves heat, but actually like there sweet bbq sauce better, because it was thicker. The hot one was pretty runny, but it did have good flavor. I had to give them 5 stars though, because the meat was amazing and I really enjoyed the coleslaw. Some people might not like that it has vinegar and no mayo, but I love that!
